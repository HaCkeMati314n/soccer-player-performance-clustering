# Soccer-Player Performance Clustering
## <i>Introduction</i>
<i><b>(Deliver actionable match insights to coaching teams)</b></i><br>

<i>Adding objectivity to reviewing team and individual player performance is essential to ensure optimal decisions are made, whether related to in-game tactical changes, player substitutions, or the interventions and practices put in place throughout the training week.<br>


<i>In this project, I'll try to deliver actionable insights to coaching teams on <mark>team performance</mark> in the first half of the game to ensure optimal decisions are made in the second half using <b>Event Data</b> provided by [Hays x MCFC Hackathon 2023](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cGrTtDJXq5otTa-mh2sB4ApTdjKMcwk7).

I aim to conduct a <b>Cluster Analysis</b> using the <b>Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm "K-Means Clustering"</b> on the Five Player-Performance Metricsâ€”Playing time, Completed passes, Shots taken, Tackles won, and Distance covered, regarding the <b>ManCityWomen</b> team in the first half of the ManCityxTottenham game.</i><br>

<i><b>Cluster Analysis</b> is a <b>Statistical Technique</b> used to <b>group similar objects or individuals into clusters</b>. In our case, the coach could use cluster analysis to group players based on their performance.</i>
