# Soccer-Player-Performance Clustering
<i>(Deliver actionable match insights to coaching teams)</i>

## An Introduction
<i>Adding objectivity to the process of reviewing team and individual player performance is critical to ensure optimal decisions are made, whether related to in-game tactical changes, player substitutions, or the interventions and practices that are put in place throughout the training week.

In this project, I aim to deliver some objectivity to the decision-making process of the coaching team at the end of the game first-half by conducting a cluster analysis using Python Machine-Learning Algorithmâ€”K-means Clustering on Five Player-Performance Metrics: Playing time, Completed passes, Shots taken, Tackles won, and Distance covered regarding the ManCityWomen team during the first half of the (ManCity x Tottenham) game using the Event-Data provided by [Hays x MCFC Hackathon 2023](https://app.hayscodeco.com/events/hackathon/be474355-e892-4604-8db8-0c3019f6c59e)</i>
