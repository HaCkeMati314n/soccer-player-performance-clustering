# Soccer-Player-Performance Clustering
<i>(A Cluster Analysis Using Python K-Means Clustering Algorithm on Five Player-Performance Metrics)</i>

## An Introduction
<i>Adding objectivity to reviewing team and individual player performance is vital to ensure optimal decisions are made, whether related to in-game tactical changes, player substitutions, or the interventions and practices put in place throughout the training week.
In this project, I aim to deliver some objectivity to the decision-making process of the coaching team at the end of the first half of the game by conducting a cluster analysis using the Machine-Learning Algorithm K-Means Clustering on Five Player-Performance Metrics: Playing time, Completed passes, Shots taken, Tackles won, and Distance covered regarding the ManCityWomen team in the first half of the ManCityxTottenham game using the data provided by Hays x MCFC Hackathon 2023</i>
