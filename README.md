# Soccer-Player Performance Clustering
## An Introduction
<I>(Deliver actionable match insights to coaching teams)</i><br>

<i>Adding objectivity to the process of reviewing team and individual player performance is critical to ensure optimal decisions are made, whether related to in-game tactical changes, player substitutions, or the interventions and practices that are put in place throughout the training week.

In this project, I aim to deliver some objectivity to the decision-making process of the coaching team at the end of the game's first half by conducting a <b>Cluster Analysis using Python Machine-Learning Algorithm: K-Means Clustering</b> on Five Player-Performance Metricsâ€”Playing time, Completed passes, Shots taken, Tackles won, and Distance covered regarding the "ManCityWomen" team during the "ManCity x Tottenham" game's first half, using the "Event-Data" provided by [Hays x MCFC Hackathon 2023](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cGrTtDJXq5otTa-mh2sB4ApTdjKMcwk7)</i>
