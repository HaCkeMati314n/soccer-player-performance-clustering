# Soccer-Player Performance Clustering
## <i>Introduction</i>
<i><b>(Deliver actionable match insights to coaching teams)</b></i><br>

<i>Adding objectivity to reviewing team and individual player performance is essential to ensure optimal decisions are made, whether related to in-game tactical changes, player substitutions, or the interventions and practices put in place throughout the training week.<br>


<i>In this project, I'll try to deliver actionable insights to coaching teams on <mark>team performance</mark> in the first half of the game to ensure optimal decisions are made in the second half using <b>Event Data</b> provided by [Hays x MCFC Hackathon 2023](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cGrTtDJXq5otTa-mh2sB4ApTdjKMcwk7).

I aim to conduct a <b>Cluster Analysis</b> using the <b>Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm "K-Means Clustering"</b> on Five Player-Performance Metrics regarding the <b>ManCityWomen</b> team in the first half of the ManCityxTottenham game.</i><br>

<i><b>Cluster Analysis</b> is a <b>Statistical Technique</b> used to <b>group similar objects or individuals into clusters</b>. In our case, the coach could use cluster analysis to group players based on their performance.</i><br>

<i>This <b>analysis can help coaches identify</b> the players who are most effective in certain areas of the field and <b>understand how the team's performance changes</b> when certain players are on the field. It can <b>recommend that the coaching team focuses on optimizing</b> the team's lineup based on the performance of individual players. For example, suppose the analysis shows that certain players are most effective when playing together. In that case, the coaching team may want to adjust the lineup to ensure that those players are on the field at the same time. It can <b>identify which groups</b> are performing well and which need improvement. The coach could then use this information <b>to make decisions about substitutions and tactical changes</b></i>.
